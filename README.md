# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to assist Kate with a business proposal to display how a bikesharing business may work in Des Moines, Iowa. To do so, NYC Citi Bike data from the month of August was analyzed to understand how the bikeshare business operates. This included analyzing data of bike usage based on the time of day, the weekday, gender, and trip duration. The objectives were to:
<br>
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
